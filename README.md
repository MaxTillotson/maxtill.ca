I have never been one to sit still for too long or take anything too seriously. However, throughout my career as a student I noticed art was a way to express my creativeness and goofiness.

After learning about Graphic Design, I pursued it as a creative outlet to get to my dream job: To Create.

Using what I have learned throughout life, I will make my career in Illustration, Branding, Motion, or whatever the world throws at me.
